# me
The Me Project - a living, collaborative autobiography

Welcome to my experiment in indentity construction, personal transperency, and community-driven self-understanding. 

This GitHub repository is hosting the characteristics, job, values, personal mission and vision, hobbies, and other personal information (that I'm willing to share) about me, Matt Farmer. 

# The Goal

This repo is designed to host continual updates, information, and version history of my personal life. People who know me can submit issues or pull requests in areas that would be considered _bugs_. At some point, I am confident that a 'codebase' about me, could be used to create a digital twin of me in the future. 

# Limitations

Privacy and transperency is a risky balance. Much of the information about me is shared online and I am willing to share it freely, but people in my life may not agree. Therefore, specific names and personal information about others will be masked or not shared to protect their privacy. 

# To Do
1. Add well-known information such as my CV, accomplishments, projects, hobbies, and values.
2. Add not-so-well known personal beliefs
3. Complete personal metadata files - beliefs.yamp, skills.csv, life-goals.md
4. Design clear boundries of what can and cannot be modified
5. Determine contribution guidelines, contributing.md, govermnance.md, personal-manifesto.md, cv.json
7. Integrate historical information archive that contains previous writings, journals, and health history.
8. Create a social network / knowledge graph of key relationships and knowledge areas
9. Create a template for issues and discussion boards that are personalized to the Me project
10. ML, NLP, and visualizations to view changes overtime, track perception changes, and predict future trajectories
11. Reputation/trust scoring for contributors
12. Github actions for automated validation
13. Semantic versioning for personal attributes
14. Test suites for data integrity
15. API endpoints for access to personal data

# Potential Advanced Features

-  Natural language processing for sentiment and tone analysis of contributions
-  Blockchain-based verification for critical identity attributes
-  Machine learning models to predict potential personal growth trajectories
-  Integration with personal development frameworks
